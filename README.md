Scalit - Literate Programming for Scala
=======================================
For my semester project at EPFL in 2008 or so,
I wrote about literate programming in Scala. The coding part consisted in
implementing the format chosen by the excellent [noweb](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/) tool and bring some compiler support to scala (so that you can,
for example, reference line numbers in the literate file, and of course get
some nicely formatted scala code in your (La)TeX documents).

The development has been done for Scala 2.7.6 and of course the world has moved on since then. Furthermore, I initially published the project on assembla,
but that is gone now, so I thought I'd push it to github.

Maybe I have time some day to write a sensible plugin to do this, or maybe
it's you, dear reader.

Cheers,
